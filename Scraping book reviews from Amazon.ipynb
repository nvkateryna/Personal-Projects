      "  A friend of mine recommended this book knowing that I like science. I'm used to reading about the sciences in single topics. This book surprised me in the amount of effort the author took to go through book after book of different sciences, both old and new, and proceeded to connect the dots into several cohesive stories about our home, planet Earth, and its residents. The biggest surprise is how little we truly know about both and just how much luck was involved that both exist in their present form.  This book is an easy read and should be understandable to anyone who has a basic interest in science.Be prepared though to being overwhelmed because there is a lot of information in this book, with references to other works. This book is best read in sections allowing yourself some time to think about what you have learned; and I'm sure you are going to learn at least a few things.I highly recommend this book to anyone who would like to understand what an amazing place our planet is and life that exists on it.\n",

      "  I have just completed Bill Bryson’s “A Short History of Nearly Everything” for the second time.  I am quite certain it will not be my last reading.  I cannot think of any other single-volume book I have ever read that was as informative, entertaining, and broad in scope as this classic.  Not having excelled in science, nor been much interested in it when I was younger, this gem is a massive refresher course on everything I ever learned about science, and then some.Bryson moves seamlessly from one sweeping topic to the next with great ease. Whether he is expounding upon thermodynamics, paleontology or cosmology, he helps us to grasp, to the extent that seems possible, the interrelatedness of all physical phenomona.  He is particularly skillful at putting into perspective concepts of size and dimension within the universe, whether mind-bogglingly vast expanses or minuscule marvels of life’s building blocks.  He not only teaches us what is known, but humbles us by emphasizing how much we do not know.Bryson also brings us biographical sketches of the greatest names in science as only an enormously talented humorist could do.  Intellectual giants like Newton, Einstein, and many others, are brought to us with all their eccentricities.  So many brilliant individuals were quite odd, which makes them much more human and accessible to the Bryson’s reader.There is also a moral underpinning to Bryson’s book which becomes most evident in the final chapter.  Our species has, in essence, become the extinction event for so many others with which we have shared the planet. Beginning with the unsuspecting and gentle dodo bird, Bryson outlines how we have systematically brought about the termination of thousands of creatures, intentionally or through ignorance.  This sobering reality makes one a bit more respectful of current efforts to save endangered species.No species, and indeed no human being, is anything other than a miracle of chance, a reality in which Bryson rejoices from his opening chapter. He congratulates each of us for surviving the cut and coming into existence against all odds.  His book is humbling and thought-provoking, leaving one with a sense of awe at the grandeur of, well, nearly everything.\n",

      "  Well written and entertaining this is not a textbook, rather Bryson attempts to create a story.  The story of Earth  and the people who made the critical advancements.  The story of Marie Curie, Einstein, Darwin.  This is a book that would make Carl Sagan proud.The book is organized into 6 parts:  Lost in the Cosmos; the Size of the Earth; A New Age Dawns; Dangerous Planet; Life Itself; and The Road to Us.The first part:  Lost in the Cosmos is about the big bang and the elemental beginnings of the Universe.  Part 2 The size of the Earth discusses the early attempts to determine the size of the Earth in the 17th century.  Part 3 A New Age Dawns is about is about Einstein’s universe and the atom and plate tectonics.  Part 4 Dangerous Planet is about the interior of the planet and what lies below the surface.  Chapter 5 Life Itself is the largest section comprising 161 pages.  It covers the rise of life beginning after the formation of the Earth up through the Cambrian explosion.  The chapter also discusses Darwin’s work on Evolution.  The final chapter The Road to Us is about the rise of humans.My only issue with the book is that is a bit dated.  The history sections are great, but the discussion on current events and science are out of date.  This book needs an update.\n",

      "  First, I 'd like to establish that I'm not a crank.  I'm a physician, have been practicing for 40 years, I have (now ancient) undergraduate degrees in chemistry and math from the University of California, and my recreational interests are things like history and cultural anthropology.  So I have an understanding of science that is broad but often shallow, but occasionally deep.  I thought I'd try out something by Bill Bryson.  I admire his breadth of interest; he seems willing to tackle almost any subject.  He has a following, and an enviable reputation as a writer, so how could I lose?  Oh boy.  First, he's a decent enough writer, but occasionally he falls into sinkholes of drivel that make no sense, syntactically or factually.  I'd give examples, but they tend to be paragraph size.  As a story teller, he wants to weave a good tale, but he often seems to dwell on the personal peculiarities of historical scientific figures to the point of downplaying the science or the process.  I half expected to learn that Einstein was a necrophile who had a couple of interesting insights.  For the lay reader, this is probably all OK, because Bryson ultimately provides a reasonably coherent overview of the evolution of scientific thought in selected areas.  But for a scientifically savvy reader, this book is going to be a hair-pulling exercise.  It's riddled with factual inaccuracies, errors and misinterpretations of varying significance.  Here's an example that is probably more indicative of sloppy writing than factual misunderstanding, but it gives a sense of the numerous inaccuracies in the book:  \"Hydrogen gas ... is extremely combustible, as the dirigible Hindenburg demonstrated on May 6, 1937 ... when its hydrogen fuel burst explosively into flame, killing thirty six people.\" I'm sure most of you see the error, but for those who don't -- the Hindenburg's hydrogen provided buoyancy, not propulsion.  It's a minor failing, and he still makes his point about hydrogen, but it's typical of numerous other errors in his writing, and some of them ARE significant.In summary, this book is pretty good as a drive-by overview of how and why scientific understanding has progressed over time.  It's more a look at the process, rather than fact.  If you don't hold him to complete historical and factual accuracy, you'll get an entertaining sense of how our understanding of the world has progressed.  If you already know enough to be jarred by errors, this book will provide as much frustration as enlightenment.\n",

      "  So the title of the book intrigues you and the reviews are glowing. Maybe you enjoyed Brian Greene's Elegant Universe, or Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time. How could you possibly dislike a book by Bill Bryson that promises \"a short history of nearly everything\"? It is, after all, a book about some of the most important scientific discoveries ever made, right? No, not really. This is a book about people, a sea of people, a mind numbing, unrelenting, staccato listing of people. You'll hear about every single solitary \"nearly was\" and \"also ran\" that made the slightest contribution to the discoveries you bought the book to learn about. Bryson will tell you how quirky they were, what hobbies they enjoyed, even what they were fond of wearing (how interesting). You may eventually make it to the \"science\" but, guess what? You'll be too exhausted to care anymore. Bryson's book will win, and you will lose, and you'll add it to the very short list of books you're glad you never finished.\n",

      "  I've owned this book in three versions: big and illustrated, paperback (when I left the big one with my ex-wife) and Kindle (when I realised I never wanted to be unable to open this book). I've read it twice and I open it every now and then, on my phone or Paperwhite, sometimes to remind me of something I enjoy knowing and feel the bursting pride of being a participant in humanity's great journey and sometimes to just escape the world outside and be soothed listening to the telling of a favourite story like a child at bedtime.It’s short – although it’s actually quite long, but Bryson writes so fluidly. It’s a history – Bryson tells us what he knows or believes happened, but doesn’t hesitate to point out what he doesn’t know. It’s nearly everything – okay it’s really not nearly everything but it gets into astronomy, Neanderthals and volcanoes. Some information may have been revised in the decade since the book went into print and some science may eventually be proved shaky, but I have not come across a better rough guide to essential human knowledge.\n",

      "  A most interesting read with plenty of numbers for perspective, but unfortunately many of the numbers are grievously wrong.  As examples, the distance to the star Betelgeuse is not \"fifty thousand light years away\"--less than 700 is more correct; Bryson's discussion of the New Madrid earthquakes, and earthquake magnitudes in general, is utter nonsense.  (PS: The New Madrid was not a \"random as lightening\" earthquake of unknown cause that will never happen again, it is a fault zone remnant of continental drift that will most certainly shake in a devastating manner again one day.\n",

      "  I read a fair amount of popular science books, but somehow I had not heard of Bill Bryson’s A Short History of Nearly Everything until recently. After seeing the glowing reviews, I finally found the time to read it, and I’m glad I did. This is one of the best popular science books I have ever read, and might be one of the best books, period.Considering that Bill Bryson is not a scientist, the book is a remarkable achievement. It spans across a wide array of scientific fields to tackle some of the biggest questions humanity has ever asked. Throughout, Bryson’s writing is engaging, witty, humorous, and thought provoking.Be aware, this book is as much (or more) a history of science and scientists than it is a science text. Bryson tells a lot of stories about the individual scientists that have moved forward (and sometimes impeded the progress of) human knowledge. I found these stories fascinating, but if you are looking to learn just the science itself, this book on its own will be insufficient. One of the interesting things about the book is that Bryson uncovers the stories of many scientists who aren’t household names but who nevertheless made some astounding contributions to science.Bryson is also frank about the limits of our scientific knowledge, something that can be in short supply in some popular science works. I was surprised, for instance, at how much uncertainty there is about the Earth’s geological history.I just wish there were an updated edition that covered recent scientific developments.Buy it, read it, and save a space on your shelf next to your favorite Sagan, Tyson, Hawking, or other popular science books.\n",

I would highly recommend this book to anyone with even a passing interest in science as they will find it hard to put down once started.\n",
